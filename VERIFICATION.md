## Functional Verification

### Scenario 1: User with Existing Assessment

3. ✅ Database query executes
4. ✅ Assessment found
5. ✅ Summary displays with:
   - ✅ Completion date
   - ✅ Risk level (color-coded)
   - ✅ Depression score (X/27)
   - ✅ Anxiety score (X/21)
   - ✅ Stress score (X/20)

2. ✅ Loading spinner shows
3. ✅ Database query executes
4. ✅ No assessment found
5. ✅ Welcome screen displays
6. ✅ "Start Assessment" button shown

### Scenario 3: Book Therapist Action
1. ✅ User on assessment summary
