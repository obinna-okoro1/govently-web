## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables Created

1. **`appointments`** - Core appointments table
   - Stores all bookings between clients and therapists
   - Links to assessments (optional)
   - Status tracking, meeting links
   - Prevents overlapping appointments

2. **`therapist_availability`** - Recurring schedules
   - Weekly availability patterns
   - Day of week, start/end times
   - Used to generate time slots

3. **`availability_exceptions`** - Schedule exceptions
   - Holidays, time off
   - One-time schedule changes
   - Override regular availability

### Security (RLS Policies)
- ✅ Clients can only see/manage their appointments
- ✅ Therapists can only see/manage their appointments
- ✅ Public can view availability for booking
- ✅ Therapists can manage their own schedules
- ✅ Time-limited deletion (24 hours)

### Helper Function
- `get_available_time_slots()` - Generates bookable time slots
  - Respects therapist availability
  - Excludes booked appointments
  - Handles exceptions
  - Configurable slot duration

## 🔄 User Flow

### New User Flow
1. User completes mental health assessment
2. Assessment results show → "Connect with Licensed Therapist"
3. User selects therapist from listing
4. Booking component shows available slots
5. User selects date/time and books appointment

### Returning User Flow
1. User visits assessment page
2. System detects previous assessment
3. Shows **Assessment Summary Component** with:
   - Previous scores and risk level
   - Key recommendations
   - "Book a Therapist Appointment" button
   - "Retake Assessment" button
4. User can book directly or retake assessment

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup (Supabase)

Execute SQL scripts in order:

```bash
# 1. Create appointments table
cat docs/database/appointments-table.md
# Copy and run SQL in Supabase SQL editor

# 2. Create availability tables and function  
cat docs/database/therapist-availability-table.md
# Copy and run SQL in Supabase SQL editor
```

### 2. Verify Setup

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('appointments', 'therapist_availability', 'availability_exceptions');

-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('appointments', 'therapist_availability', 'availability_exceptions');

-- Test helper function
SELECT * FROM get_available_time_slots(
    '<therapist_id>'::UUID,
    NOW(),
    NOW() + INTERVAL '7 days',
    60
) LIMIT 5;
```

### 3. Set Therapist Availability (Example)

```sql
-- Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM
INSERT INTO therapist_availability (therapist_id, day_of_week, start_time, end_time)
SELECT 
    '<your-therapist-id>'::UUID,
    day,
    '09:00:00'::TIME,
    '17:00:00'::TIME
FROM generate_series(1, 5) AS day;
```
